[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

The Stock Index API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/stockindex](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/stockindex?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

const stockindexAPI = require('@apiverve/stockindex');
const api = new stockindexAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  index: "sp500",
  year: 2023
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  index: "sp500",
  year: 2023
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  index: "sp500",
  year: 2023
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "index": "sp500",
    "name": "S&P 500",
    "value": 6882.72,
    "date": "2026-02-04",
    "lastUpdated": "2026-02-07T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```
